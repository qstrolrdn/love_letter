Dear Biya,

I would like to name our love story as "In the Name of Us". Why? because everything that we do, every efforts we make, through hardships and the gala, the tears, the overthinking, doubts and the laughs â€” It's all for the sake of building a healthy relationship wherein we're both capable of helping and supporting eachothers dream. WHICH DEFINES "US".

firstly, sorry for the doubts na binibigay ko sayo ah? :(( I'm sorry for making you feel like an option especially nung nabasa mo yung message na about sa ex ko. I don't hate you for being like that, it is reasonable to feel like that. I truly understand you, which is why im very sorry.. Kahit naman malagay ako sa ganyang situation I would also feel the same eh xjasudhas, pero please don't let that overthinking kill you :(( Hard to believe for you na nakamove-on na ako pero i know myself very well biya.

I told god na this will be my last risk. I told god if it isn't you I don't want to love no more.. I always tell that to mark din :(( He knows how much I am willing to do everything just to let you stay. I am ready to pour every single bit of sweat, blood, EVERY EFFORTS THAT YOU NEED, EVERY LOVE THAT YOU NEED UNTIL EVERYTHING DRAINS ME OUT. I am ready, to pour everything. Indeed, everything :)) just please, end up with me.

As what I've heard from your parents, sobrang moody ka daw. I know that naman na eh :)) I am willing to adjust and pursue you whatever flaws they might see around you, no one will be able to understand my feelings when it comes to you, not even me :)) because my love isn't reasonable It is unique and permanent I am not a person that only stays dahil maganda ka, dahil matalino ka, dahil understanding ka. I am willing to stay no matter how hard the tide is, no matter how rough our path may be. You already had a special place in my heart, a place that no one could ever replace nor removed.

I won't make it long, lahat ilalagay ko na sa handmade letters ko, pero I am willing to do everything just to pursue you. I find peace when it comes to youâ€”It is what I am seeking when it comes to relationship, every relationships that I had been through I had never experienced peace and love at the same time. They weren't able to gain the title of being my comfort zone, but you did.

You are the most wonderful person that I had ever been with biya, if I were to tell your value, your value is incomparable, unexchangeable & priceless. You are worth more than a galaxy, you're the person I am willing to die for, whatever happens isa-sacrifice ko just for you :(( body, time, money? You can take those, you can access everything around me, YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO DO EVERYTHING SA LIFE KO, dhasyxhsa, if you want eh you can control me na din :)) if you want to use me for self-development edi I'm willing to.. I KNOW NA HINDI KA GANON, pero I am telling you how much I am willing to sacrifice everything just to feel your touch and just to pursue you my iris.

So, Biya :))

Will you?
Accept me?
As Your, Manliligaw?

:))


There's more, it'll all be in the handmade letter and gifts. I just want to know your answer so my letter would depend on your answer today, it is either you would take the risk or play safe.

Forever and sincerely,
Nathan
